# CS5500-Final-Project

This repository stores work for a project I contributed to as part of Northeastern University's CS5500: Foundations of Software Engineering course.
We were given permission to publicly share the code, but the GitHub history does not reflect my contributions vs. the contributions of my 3 teammates on the project.

The idea of the project was to create a simple but collaborative painting app. It involved networking as well as coding in the D coding language. We also use the SDL library in D.

Feel free to watch [this demo of our project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kWuVKq7stfeg-XfQXiMbljG5c6fvOt3E/view) that demonstrates some of the code and features of the Painting App
